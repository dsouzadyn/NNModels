# NNModels
A small project to test my ability to code in Tensorflow. If the optimizers I'm using don't make sense, they probably don't. Please feel free to make a pull request.
Data from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com).
### Requirements
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- PyCharm (Optional)

### Usage
1. Run the trainer.
